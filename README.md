# Simple Snake Game

## Introduction

The Simple Snake Game is a basic implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, the player controls a snake that grows longer as it consumes food. The objective is to avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body while trying to eat as much food as possible.

## Structure

The project consists of three main files:

+ `index.html`: Defines the structure of the game, including the game area where the snake and food are displayed.
+ `style.css`: Provides the styling for the game, including the appearance of the snake, food, and game area.
+ `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code that handles the game logic, including snake movement, food placement, collision detection, and user input.

## Features

+ **Snake Movement:** The snake moves in the direction specified by the player using arrow keys.
+ **Growing Snake:** The snake grows in length each time it eats the food.
+ **Random Food Placement:** Food appears at random positions within the game area.
+ **Collision Detection:** The game detects collisions with the walls or the snake's own body, ending the game if a collision occurs.
+ **Game Over Alert:** An alert is displayed to notify the player when the game is over.
